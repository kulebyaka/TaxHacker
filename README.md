## üëãüèª Getting Started

TaxHacker is a self-hosted accounting app for freelancers and small businesses who want to save time and automate expences and income tracking with power of GenAI. It can recognise uploaded photos, receipts or PDFs and extract important data (e.g. name, total amount, date, merchant, VAT) and save it as structured transactions to a table. You can also create your own custom fields to extract with your LLM prompts.

It supports automatic currency conversion on a day of transaction. Even for crypto!

Built-in system of filters, support for multiple projects, import-export of transactions for a certain time (along with attached files) and custom categories, allows you to simplify reporting and tax filing.

### `7` Local data storage and self-hosting

![Self-hosting](docs/screenshots/exported_archive.png)

## üõ≥ Deploying or Self-hosting

TaxHacker can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure for complete control over your data and application environment. We provide a [Docker image](./Dockerfile) and [Docker Compose](./docker-compose.yml) files that makes setting up TaxHacker simple:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vas3k/TaxHacker/main/docker-compose.yml

docker compose up
```

The Docker Compose setup includes:

- TaxHacker application container
- PostgreSQL 17 database container
- Automatic database migrations
- Volume mounts for persistent data storage

New docker image is automatically built and published on every new release. You can use specific version tags (e.g. `v1.0.0`) or `latest` for the most recent version.

For more advanced setups, you can adapt Docker Compose configuration to your own needs. The default configuration uses the pre-built image from GHCR, but you can still build locally using the provided [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) if needed.

For example:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/vas3k/taxhacker:latest
    ports:
      - "7331:7331"
    environment:
      - SELF_HOSTED_MODE=true
      - UPLOAD_PATH=/app/data/uploads
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/taxhacker
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Environment Variables

Configure TaxHacker to suit your needs with these environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Description | Example |

| `BASE_URL` | No | Base URL for the application | `http://localhost:7331` |
| `SELF_HOSTED_MODE` | No | Set it to "true" if you're self-hosting the app: it enables auto-login, custom API keys, and more | `true` |
| `DISABLE_SIGNUP` | No | Disable new user registration on your instance | `false` |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Yes | Secret key for authentication (min 16 characters) | `random-secret-key` |
| `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME` | No | OpenAI model to use for AI features | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | No | OpenAI API key for AI features. In self-hosted mode you can set it up in settings too. | `sk-...` |


## ‚å®Ô∏è Local Development

We use:

- Next.js version 15+ or later
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for database models and migrations
- PostgreSQL as a database (PostgreSQL 17+ recommended)
- Ghostscript and graphicsmagick libs for PDF files (can be installed on macOS via `brew install gs graphicsmagick`)

Set up a local development environment with these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vas3k/TaxHacker.git
cd TaxHacker

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your configuration
# Make sure to set DATABASE_URL to your PostgreSQL connection string
# Example: postgresql://user@localhost:5432/taxhacker

# Initialize the database
npx prisma generate && npx prisma migrate dev

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:7331` to see your local instance of TaxHacker.

For a production build, instead of `npm run dev` use the following commands:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm run start
```
